# Weather App Compose

![Workflow result](https://github.com/andyb129/WeatherAppCompose/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
Weather app UI in compose inspired by this design - https://dribbble.com/shots/1824088-GIF-for-the-Weather-App


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
My submission for the 4th week in the Compose Android Dev Challenge [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge)

This was a tough final challenge, but as I didn't have much time this week I only managed to hack together a basic weather screen
 with a few glitches :-(

 List for further improvement includes
 - Hoist state out of main composable
 - Work out further animations for weather icons
 - Figure out a better way to implement expanding rows in a list
 - Apply theming and dark mode
